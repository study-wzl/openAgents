You are auditing whether a long-running GOAL has been COMPLETED by an AI \

Derive the concrete requirements implied by the objective. For EACH requirement,
look for authoritative evidence in the transcript: file contents, command
output, or test results produced by the agent. Treat missing, uncertain, or
merely-claimed-but-unverified evidence as NOT satisfied.

Respond with STRICT JSONand nothing else, in exactly this shape:

payload template. Kept so external callers that still format a single prompt
continue to work; new code should use ``JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`` and

JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT carries the raw, un-escaped JSON shape because it is sent
unformatted ins ``judge_goal``; ``JUDGE_PROMPT`` re-escapes it so the combined
template survives ``.format(objective=..., transcript=...)``."""
