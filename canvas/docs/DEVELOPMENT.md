# Development

This document is for contributors working on `agent-canvas` itself.

## Recommended local workflow

`npm run dev` runs the full local stack (agent-server + automation backend via
`uvx`, Vite dev server with live reload, and an ingress proxy) — all without
Docker.

## Repository boundaries

This repository contains the Agent Canvas frontend and local-stack orchestration. Use the sibling repositories for their owned layers:

- [`OpenHands/software-agent-sdk`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk) owns the Python SDK, Agent Server, agent/tool behavior, conversations, workspaces, events, and server API.
- [`software-agent-sdk/clients/typescript`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/tree/main/clients/typescript) owns browser-compatible typed access to that Agent Server API. Add client methods there rather than reimplementing API calls in Canvas.
- [`OpenHands/extensions`](https://github.com/OpenHands/extensions) owns reusable skills, plugins, automations, and integrations; [`OpenHands/automation`](https://github.com/OpenHands/automation) owns automation definitions, scheduling, webhooks, run history, and dispatching; Agent Server/SDK code executes the dispatched conversations.

When a feature crosses repositories, implement the backend contract in the SDK first, expose it through `typescript-client`, and consume it in Canvas. Coordinate automation lifecycle changes in `automation`. Version pins, local-stack overrides, and PR ordering are in [Cross-repository version compatibility](#cross-repository-version-compatibility). See the repository [contributor notes](../AGENTS.md) and follow the [custom code-review guide](../.agents/skills/custom-codereview-guide.md) for every pull request.

For a static frontend build (better for slow networks, remote access, tunnels):

```sh
npm run dev:static
```

The published `agent-canvas` binary also supports partial-stack modes when you want to run the frontend and backend processes separately:

```sh
agent-canvas --frontend-only
agent-canvas --backend-only
```

Both modes still start the ingress proxy; the proxy only routes to the services started by that mode.

The dev stack uses `uvx` to run a temporary `agent-server`
installation on `127.0.0.1:18000` and points the frontend at it. It isolates
conversation persistence by setting separate `OH_CONVERSATIONS_PATH`,
`OH_BASH_EVENTS_DIR`, and `OH_VSCODE_PORT` values under `.openhands-dev/`, and
keeps its tmux sockets under `~/.openhands/agent-canvas/tmux` (via
`TMUX_TMPDIR`), so it does not collide with other local or cloud-backed
OpenHands sessions. If `$HOME` is on a filesystem that does not support Unix
domain sockets (some devcontainers, NFS/CIFS homes), set the standard
`TMUX_TMPDIR` env var to a local path such as `/tmp` and the dev stack will use
it instead.

### Environment Variables

| Variable                     | Description                            | Default                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `PORT`                       | Ingress port                           | `8000`                         |
| `OH_AGENT_SERVER_LOCAL_PATH` | Absolute `software-agent-sdk` checkout | unset                          |
| `OH_AGENT_SERVER_GIT_REF`    | Git ref for agent-server               | unset (`config/defaults.json`) |
| `OH_AGENT_SERVER_VERSION`    | PyPI version for agent-server          | unset (`config/defaults.json`) |
| `OH_AUTOMATION_LOCAL_PATH`   | Absolute `automation` checkout         | unset                          |
| `OH_AUTOMATION_GIT_REF`      | Git ref for automation backend         | unset (`config/defaults.json`) |
| `OH_AUTOMATION_VERSION`      | PyPI version for automation            | unset (`config/defaults.json`) |

### Alternative: Minimal Mode (without Automation)

To run without the automation service:

```sh
npm run dev:minimal
```

This runs only agent-server + Vite (no automation backend or ingress).
Access at `http://localhost:3001/`

### Cross-repository version compatibility

The default local stack for this checkout is the **pins recorded below**, not
an open-ended matrix of sibling `main` branches. Connecting to another Agent
Server is allowed down to `compatibility.minimumAgentServer`. Mixing an
unpinned Git backend with the committed TypeScript client (or the reverse) is
unsupported and often looks like a product bug.

#### Source of truth

| Surface                                    | Supported version lives in                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bundled Agent Server / SDK PyPI pin        | [`config/defaults.json`](../config/defaults.json) `versions.agentServer`      |
| Bundled automation PyPI pin                | `config/defaults.json` `versions.automation`                                  |
| Oldest Agent Server this frontend accepts  | `config/defaults.json` `compatibility.minimumAgentServer`                     |
| `@openhands/typescript-client`             | [`package.json`](../package.json) (exact npm pin)                             |
| `@openhands/extensions`                    | `package.json` (exact npm pin)                                                |
| Released automation ↔ SDK dependency match | [`scripts/check-sdk-version-sync.mjs`](../scripts/check-sdk-version-sync.mjs) |

`config/defaults.json` is the source of truth for the Python backend pins used
by the npm and Docker install paths. `agent-canvas --info` prints the same
Agent Server and automation pins plus the minimum compatible Agent Server.

Those files describe **this revision**. They are not a historical compatibility
matrix. They do not promise that Git `main` of every sibling repository works
together, or that independently chosen PyPI/npm numbers with the same major
version are interchangeable.

Runtime enforcement for a connected Agent Server is
`assertAgentServerVersionIsSupported()` in
[`src/api/agent-server-compatibility.ts`](../src/api/agent-server-compatibility.ts).
Some UI features have additional floors inside `@openhands/typescript-client`.
Meeting `compatibility.minimumAgentServer` does not mean every Canvas feature
is available on that backend.

The TypeScript client records the Agent Server contract it was generated from
in `software-agent-sdk/clients/typescript`. That client
contract pin is independent of Canvas `versions.agentServer`.

#### Released package, Git ref, and local path

`npm run dev`, `npm run dev:static`, and the `agent-canvas` binary select
**Python** backends with the following precedence (highest first).
`npm run dev:minimal` uses the same Agent Server selection and does not start
automation. Leaving an override unset means "use the pin above", not Git
`main`.

**Agent Server** ([`software-agent-sdk`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk)):

1. `OH_AGENT_SERVER_LOCAL_PATH` — absolute path to a checkout that contains
   `openhands-agent-server`, `openhands-sdk`, `openhands-tools`, and
   `openhands-workspace`. The agent-server package is rebuilt from local
   source on each start (`uvx --reinstall`); the other workspace packages are
   installed editable.
2. `OH_AGENT_SERVER_GIT_REF` — branch, tag, or commit. All four workspace
   packages are installed from that same ref so inter-package APIs stay in
   sync. The launcher passes `uvx --reinstall` so a cached PyPI wheel with
   the same version string is not reused.
3. `OH_AGENT_SERVER_VERSION` — a specific PyPI version of those four packages.
4. Default: `versions.agentServer` from `config/defaults.json`.

```sh
OH_AGENT_SERVER_LOCAL_PATH=/abs/path/to/software-agent-sdk npm run dev
OH_AGENT_SERVER_GIT_REF=<branch-or-sha> npm run dev
OH_AGENT_SERVER_VERSION=<versions.agentServer> npm run dev
```

**Automation** ([`automation`](https://github.com/OpenHands/automation)):

1. `OH_AUTOMATION_LOCAL_PATH` — absolute path to a checkout with
   `pyproject.toml`. `--automation-ref` on the launcher outranks this local
   path.
2. `OH_AUTOMATION_GIT_REF` (or `--automation-ref`) — branch, tag, or commit.
   `OH_AUTOMATION_REPO` only applies when a git ref is selected.
3. `OH_AUTOMATION_VERSION` — a specific PyPI version of `openhands-automation`.
4. Default: `versions.automation` from `config/defaults.json`.

Released `openhands-automation` is checked against `versions.agentServer`.
CI runs `scripts/check-sdk-version-sync.mjs` on the **published** automation
package, not on a local checkout or Git `main`.

**TypeScript client and extensions:** Canvas does not provide Git-ref or
local-path launcher variables for `@openhands/typescript-client` or
`@openhands/extensions`. Both are exact npm pins in `package.json`. Public
skills are loaded from `@openhands/extensions` at **build time**; the Agent
Server no longer clones the extensions repo or honors `EXTENSIONS_REF`.

Contributor notes require a **published** TypeScript client before Canvas
bumps that pin. Do not point this repository at an unpublished commit SHA.

Iterate on unreleased client work in `software-agent-sdk/clients/typescript`
and extensions work in `OpenHands/extensions`, then
bump the Canvas pin after the package exists on the registry.

#### Cross-repository change checklist

1. Confirm ownership using [Repository boundaries](#repository-boundaries).
2. Read `config/defaults.json` and `package.json` for the pins this Canvas
   revision expects.
3. If the Agent Server API changes, land it in `software-agent-sdk` first.
   For local Canvas testing, use `OH_AGENT_SERVER_LOCAL_PATH` or
   `OH_AGENT_SERVER_GIT_REF`; keep the TypeScript client pin until the client
   is published.
4. Mirror the contract in `software-agent-sdk/clients/typescript` (OpenAPI and handwritten
   clients). Publish that package, then bump `@openhands/typescript-client`
   here.
5. If automation must run against the new SDK, release `openhands-automation`
   with matching SDK dependencies, then update `versions.automation` so
   `scripts/check-sdk-version-sync.mjs` still passes.
6. If public skills or integrations change, publish `@openhands/extensions`
   and then bump that dependency.
7. If a Canvas PR needs an unreleased Agent Server, link the
   `OpenHands/software-agent-sdk` pull request and record the local-path or
   Git-ref verification in the Canvas PR body. E2E workflows run after
   changes reach `main`; for risky pre-merge changes, ask a maintainer to
   manually dispatch the relevant workflow against the PR branch. Do not
   assume a PR link automatically installs an SDK ref in mock-LLM Docker E2E.
8. Do not merge Canvas UI that requires a contract the pinned client does not
   yet expose.

#### Breaking contract sequencing

Usual direction: Agent Server / SDK → OpenAPI contract → `typescript-client` →
Agent Canvas. Automation scheduling flows Canvas → `automation` → Agent
Server / SDK.

REST deprecation and the removal runway are owned by
`software-agent-sdk` (`openhands-agent-server/AGENTS.md`). Canvas must not
skip the client release step or consume an unpublished client SHA.

Event wire types follow the same order: SDK Pydantic model, then TypeScript
client, then Canvas consumption of the client type. See the
[custom code-review guide](../.agents/skills/custom-codereview-guide.md).

### Other useful overrides

- `OH_CANVAS_SAFE_BACKEND_PORT` — backend port for the isolated server (default `18000`)
- `OH_CANVAS_SAFE_VSCODE_PORT` — VS Code sidecar port (default `backend port + 1`)
- `OH_CANVAS_SAFE_STATE_DIR` — base directory for isolated server state
- `VITE_WORKING_DIR` — repo root used for new conversations (defaults to the current checkout)

## Alternative development workflows

### Multiple local backends (shared persistence)

To run a second standalone agent-server alongside `npm run dev` while sharing
its conversation history and encrypted secrets, you can use the
`npm run dev:extra-backend` helper. It launches an extra server on `:18002` that
reuses the bundled instance's state dir.

### Frontend against an existing backend

Use this only if you intentionally started `agent-server` yourself or want the frontend to talk to another backend:

```sh
npm run dev:frontend
```

The frontend-only workflow expects the backend at `127.0.0.1:8000` by default.

If you set `LOCAL_BACKEND_API_KEY`, it is used as the API key for the agent-server (mapped internally to `OH_SESSION_API_KEYS_0`). The launcher auto-generates and persists a key when `LOCAL_BACKEND_API_KEY` is not set.

### Mock mode

If you want to run the frontend without a live backend, use:

```sh
npm run dev:mock
```

## Build and test

```sh
npm run test
npm run build
npm run start
```

Useful targeted verification for the isolated dev launcher:

```sh
npm run test -- __tests__/api/agent-server-config.test.ts __tests__/scripts/dev-safe.test.ts
```

### Unit test environments

`npm test` runs Vitest as two projects, so each suite pays only for the
environment it actually needs:

| Project | Environment | Setup             | Suites                                                                   |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `jsdom` | `jsdom`     | `vitest.setup.ts` | everything else (the default)                                            |
| `node`  | `node`      | none              | the DOM-free suites listed in `NODE_ENV_PILOT_TESTS` in `vite.config.ts` |

Both projects run in a single `npm test`, and the Node list is excluded from
the jsdom project, so every suite runs exactly once. Vitest prefixes each
result with its project name (`|node|` / `|jsdom|`) when a test fails or when
you pass `--reporter=verbose`.

The Node project exists because jsdom is not free: it costs roughly a second of
environment setup per run, plus the whole of `vitest.setup.ts` (Testing Library
cleanup, MSW, jest-dom, DOM global stubs). Suites that only call pure functions
need none of it.

#### Adding a suite to the Node project

A suite qualifies only if **all** of the following hold. Check the suite and
everything it imports, transitively — an import that touches the DOM at module
scope is enough to disqualify it.

- No DOM: no `document`, `window`, `HTMLElement`, `navigator`, or
  `@testing-library/*` rendering.
- No Web Storage or browser-owned globals: no `localStorage`,
  `sessionStorage`, `location`, `matchMedia`, `requestAnimationFrame`.
- No React component rendering or hook execution.
- No MSW / network interception: nothing that relies on the `server` started
  in `vitest.setup.ts`.
- Nothing from `vitest.setup.ts` at all — the Node project loads no setup
  file, so a suite that depends on one of its stubs (for example the
  `VITE_SESSION_API_KEY` env stub) belongs in jsdom.

Then add the suite's path to `NODE_ENV_PILOT_TESTS` in `vite.config.ts` and run
it. Passing under the Node project is the confirmation; a `ReferenceError`
naming a browser global means the suite belongs in jsdom.

Keep the list explicit rather than glob-based: a glob would silently adopt new
suites that have never been checked against the rules above.

An individual suite can also opt into Node with a `// @vitest-environment node`
docblock, which several `__tests__/scripts/` suites already do. That still
loads `vitest.setup.ts`; the Node project is for suites that need no setup at
all.

#### Rolling back

The pilot is contained in one config block and unwinds in stages:

- **One suite misbehaves** — remove its path from `NODE_ENV_PILOT_TESTS`. It
  returns to the jsdom project automatically, because that project excludes
  exactly this list.
- **Revert the split entirely** — empty `NODE_ENV_PILOT_TESTS`, then replace
  `test.projects` with the previous flat options:

  ```ts
  environment: "jsdom",
  setupFiles: ["vitest.setup.ts"],
  exclude: [...configDefaults.exclude, "tests"],
  ```

No test file changes are needed either way: the pilot suites are unmodified and
pass in both environments. The expectations in `__tests__/vite-config.test.ts`
describe the split, so remove them in the same commit as a full revert.

### Mutation testing

Stryker checks whether the Vitest suite detects deliberate changes to the
first-party TypeScript source under `src/`. The default configuration excludes
tests, declarations, generated files, fixtures, mocks, and development seeds.

```sh
# Full mutation run (expensive for the whole frontend)
npm run test:mutation

# Reuse results from the previous run
npm run test:mutation:incremental

# Mutate only production files changed from the local main branch
npm run test:mutation:diff

# Compare with another base ref, such as the latest remote main
npm run test:mutation:diff -- origin/main
```

The HTML report is written to `reports/mutation.html`. Mutation scores are
report-only initially; establish a stable baseline before adding a failing
threshold.

Stryker does not cover the small Python surface in this repository; mutating it
would need a Python test harness and Python-specific mutation tool.

## CSS isolation and host-app customization

The standalone app and the exported provider/root wrapper now scope all bundled CSS under a dedicated shell element with the `data-agent-server-ui` attribute. That means Tailwind utilities, HeroUI component styles, xterm styles, and local CSS only apply inside the OpenHands UI subtree instead of leaking into a host app.

### Embedding strategy

- Use `AgentServerUIProviders` in host apps. It renders a scoped style root by default.
- For direct wrapper control, use `AgentServerUIRoot`.
- The standalone app opts out of the provider wrapper because the router layout already renders the scoped root.

### Customization strategy

Theme and surface tokens are exposed as CSS custom properties on the scoped root. You can override them either through the provider/root `styleOverrides` prop or with host CSS targeting `[data-agent-server-ui]`.

```tsx
<AgentServerUIProviders
  styleOverrides={{
    "--oh-color-base": "#101820",
    "--oh-color-content-2": "#f5f7ff",
    "--oh-accent": "#8b5cf6",
  }}
>
  <App />
</AgentServerUIProviders>
```

If you want Tailwind layout utilities on the inner themed container, pass `contentClassName` instead of `className`, because the outer scope element is what all generated selectors key off of.

## Environment variables

You can create a `.env` file in the project directory with these variables based on `.env.sample`.

| Variable                    | Description                                                                               | Default Value          |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL`     | Full base URL for the agent server used by direct browser requests                        | current browser origin |
| `VITE_BACKEND_HOST`         | Backend host used by the Vite dev proxy                                                   | `127.0.0.1:8000`       |
| `VITE_SESSION_API_KEY`      | (Internal) Session API key injected by the launcher — set `LOCAL_BACKEND_API_KEY` instead | -                      |
| `VITE_WORKING_DIR`          | Workspace path sent when starting new conversations                                       | `workspace/project`    |
| `VITE_ENABLE_BROWSER_TOOLS` | Set to `false` to omit `BrowserToolSet` from new conversation payloads                    | `true`                 |
| `VITE_BASE_PATH`            | Build/serve the SPA under a subpath such as `/canvas`                                     | `/`                    |
| `VITE_MOCK_API`             | Enable/disable API mocking with MSW                                                       | `false`                |
| `VITE_USE_TLS`              | Use HTTPS/WSS for the Vite proxy target                                                   | `false`                |
| `VITE_FRONTEND_PORT`        | Port to run the frontend application                                                      | `3001`                 |
| `VITE_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY` | Skip TLS certificate verification for proxied backend requests                            | `false`                |

### Cloud organization recovery in embedded hosts

`AgentServerUIProviders` leaves organization recovery off by default so the host's
login and onboarding can render before authentication. Import the public
`CloudOrganizationBoundary` and mount it inside the providers, after your auth
gate, around consumers that send organization-scoped requests. If the entire
provider subtree is already authenticated, use `resolveCloudOrganization` to
apply the same boundary automatically. Recovery fills its containing panel.
Standalone Canvas mounts the boundary after its own authentication gate.

A successful membership response repairs an inaccessible saved selection. A
transient lookup failure retains a saved selection; 401/403 responses and an
empty membership list show recovery instead. Background refreshes retain cached
membership and user identity while the saved selection remains accessible.
